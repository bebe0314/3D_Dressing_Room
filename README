Build Notes (for Win32):
------------------------

Requirements:
	1) Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
	2) Ogre SDK for Visual Studio 2010 (http://www.ogre3d.org/download/sdk)
	3) NVidia CG (http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cg_download.html)
	4) OpenNI (www.openni.org)
	5) Sensor device modules for OpenNI (www.openni.org)
	6) NITE modules for OpenNI (www.openni.org)
	   
Building Sinbad:
	1) Create an environment variable called OGRE_HOME which points to the root of the Ogre SDK directory.
	2) Use the supplied SinbadVS2010.sln file to compile the project.
	3) Run Sinbad.exe from the bin directory. (or from bindbg if you've compiled in debug)

Important note:
To save space we did not include the debug Ogre DLLs in this package.
If you want the project to work in debug mode you would need to:
1) Copy the Data directory from the bin into the bindbg directory.
2) Copy cg.dll from the bin into the bindbg directory.
3) Copy all the dll files from the Ogre SDK (bin\debug) into the bindbg directory.
   *** Do NOT copy over .cfg files from the ogre directory into the bindbg directory. Only copy the dll files!!! ***
